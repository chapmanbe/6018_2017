## Prerequisite

Prior to starting this course, the student must have completed a basic programming class. Online courses, such as [codecademy’s Python Course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python) or [Coursera's Programming for Everybody](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python), are fine with proof of completion.

## Course Description

This course will provide students in the biological and medical domains the foundational programming skills to create computer programs to manage and analyze data drawn from clinical, biological, and public health domains. Working with the Python programming language, students will learn how to write procedural and object oriented programs. Mathematical principles relevant to biomedical data science will be reviewed through programming examples and problems. Students will also develop competency in using software version control with git as well as how to work within Linux computing environments.

## Text Books

### Programming

There is no required textbook for this course. However, I will make a PDF copy of Allen Downey's *Think Python, version 2* available through Canvas. This is book with a Creative Commons license, so if you are interested you can [clone](https://github.com/AllenDowney/ThinkPython2), edit, and build your own copy of the book. For relevant modules, I will provide references to readings in Downey's book.

In addition there are a number of very useful books that are available online through the University of Utah's subscription to the [Safari Technical Books Online](http://proquest.safaribooksonline.com.ezproxy.lib.utah.edu/).

### Mathematics

As part of this class we will be reviewing some foundational mathematics as they related to computational issues in biomedical informatics. Some of the mathematics books that I will be drawing materials from include:

* [Doing Math with Python](https://www.nostarch.com/doingmathwithpython)
* [Mathematics for the Life Sciences](http://www.springer.com/us/book/9781461472759)
* [Mathematics in the Real World](http://www.springer.com/us/book/9781461485285)

##  Learning Objectives

Upon completing this course students will be able to:

1. Develop biomedical software applications in the Python programming language.
1. Develop pipelines for manipulating, analyzing, and visualizing biomedical data.
1. Follow software engineering principles such as version control, documentation, and testing while developing biomedical software.
1. Use basic mathematical principles (e.g. set theory, first order logic, calculus, linear algebra, probability, and graph theory) to motivate and inform computational problems in biology and healthcare.

## Evaluation Methods

1. Quizzes: 10% of grade.
  * Quizzes will be based on class-preparation materials to ensure that the students have reviewed the materials prior to the start of class.
1. Class Participation: 10% of grade
    1. I will not keep attendance, but I do expect reasonable attendance and participation with in-class activities, peer review of assignments, etc.
1. Homework Assignments: 35%
  * There will be homework assignments for each module.  
1. Term Project: 30%
1. Final Exam: 15%

##  Teaching and Learning Methods                 

This class will follow a “flipped classroom” paradigm. Students will be expected to watch prepared videos and read relevant on-line materials prior to the start of class. Class time will be spent answering questions raised by on-line materials, clarifying topics, and participating in individual and group hands-on activities. Students are encouraged to work in groups.

## Writing

While this course does not include a formal written component, students are required to write documentation for all their code following standard Python conventions.

## Analytical

The analytical component of this course includes review of foundational mathematical concepts that are of importance to biomedical informatics.
