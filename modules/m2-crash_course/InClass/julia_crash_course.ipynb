    "# Julia Crash course \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will quickly go over Julia at a high level. We will then go on to explore topics in more detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Greek philosopher Pythagoras reportedly said, \"All is number!\". Deep down in the computer, Pythagoras is correct but in this course we are primarily going to think of data as consisting of **strings** and **numbers**. Adopting a physical metaphor, we can say that numbers and strings are our atoms of data. We can then combine numbers and strings to create molecules of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Computer programs read, manipulate, and output data using **functions** which are either native to the programming language or created by a programmer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Julia and Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Julia is a functional programming language; it is built around the philosophy of functions operating on data. It is not an object oriented language, like Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important components of the programs we will be writing are **data structures** and **functions.** Using a biology analogy, data structures are like the blood circulating through our bodies and function objects are like our organs that take blood in and return modified blood and some biological behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a Function?\n",
    "\n",
    "* \"any of a group of related actions contributing to a larger action; especially : the normal and specific contribution of a bodily part to the economy of a living organism\" \n",
    "* \"a computer subroutine; specifically : one that performs a calculation with variables provided by a program and supplies the program with a single result\"([Merriam-Webster Dictionary](http://www2.merriam-webster.com/cgi-bin/mwdictadu?book=Dictionary&va=functionless))\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Eventually we will learn how to define our own functions, but for now we will spend some time getting familiar with using the functions that are already defined in Julia.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get a handle on what a function is in Julia, let's look at some example functions from \"high school\" mathematics\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "y = f(x)\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "we would read this as \"$y$ is equal to a function $f$ which has an argument $x$.\" $f$ is a symbol for \"some function\", the argument $x$ might be called the *independent variable*, and $y$ might be called the the *dependent variable*. Familiar, \"school mathematics\" examples of functions might include the following:\n",
    "\\begin{eqnarray}\n",
    "y = \\sqrt{x},\\\\\n",
    "y = mx+b.\n",
    "\\end{eqnarray}\n",
    "\n",
    "In each of these examples, we take a value $x$ and returns a new value that we are assigning to the variable $y$. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Take $x$ as input and return the square root of $x$ as output. \n",
    "1. Take $x$ as input and return $x$ multiplied by $m$ plus $b$. We can generalize this pattern with the following \"definition\":\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A \"definition\" of functions: A function is something that takes some kind of input and provides some sort of output\n",
    "\n",
    "## An Aside: A Comment on Comments\n",
    "\n",
    "A comment isn't actually part of Julia---a comment is something that doesn't exist in the running program---but it is part of a the written Julia script or program.\n",
    "\n",
    "A comment in a Julia script is the pound symbol (``#``) and everything that follows it on a line. Once Julia encounters a ``#``, it ignores everything that follows. Comments are important for us on the human end of the program. They help us understand what the programmer (perhaps us) was thinking or trying to do when the code was written.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a brief illustration of a comment, execute the cell below with and without the leading ``#``."
