    ">Set theory is the foundation of the edifice of modern mathematics. The precise definitions of all mathematical concepts are based on set theory. Furthermore, the methods of mathematical deduction are characterized by a combination of logical and set-theoretical arguments. To put it briefly, the language of set theory is the common idiom spoken and understood by mathematicians the world over. From all this it follows that if one is to make any progress in higher mathematics itself or in its practical applications, one has to become familiar with the basic concepts and results of set theory and with the language in which they are expressed.

For the induction step suppose that the statement is true for a set with $N-1$ elements, and let $S$ be a set with $N$ elements. Remove on element $x$ from S to obtain a set $T$ with $N-1$ elements. There are two types of subsets of $S$: those that contain $x$ and those that do not contain $x$. The latter are subsets of $T$, of which there are $2^{N-1}$. Every subset $P$ of $S$ that does contain $x$ can be obtained from a subset $Q$ of $T$ by adding $x$. The set $Q$ is simply the set $P$ with $x$ removed. Clearly there is a unique and distinct set $Q$ for each set $P$ and every subset $Q$ of $T$ gives rise to a unique and distinct subset $P$ of $S$. There are thus also $2^{(N-1)}$ subsets of $S$ that contain $x$, for a total of $2^{(N-1)}$ + $2^{(N-1)} = 2^N$ ([Peter Alfeld](http://www.math.utah.edu/~pa/math/sets/powerproof.html))\n"
